# TypeScript Core Package Enhancement Tasks

## Executive Summary

**Project:** Complete TypeScript Core API Implementation for AIR Proving Examples  
**Priority:** P0 (Critical Path)  
**Timeline:** 2-3 sprints  
**Assignee:** Core Team  

Our current TypeScript implementation relies on mock/simulation code instead of real cryptographic primitives. This technical debt blocks production readiness and 1:1 API parity with our Rust reference implementation.

## Context & Problem Statement

Currently, examples 03-05 use placeholder implementations instead of the actual TypeScript core APIs:
- **Example 03:** Mock merkle tree commitments instead of real `CommitmentSchemeProver`
- **Example 04:** Simulated constraint evaluation instead of real `FrameworkComponent` evaluation  
- **Example 05:** Completely simulated proof generation/verification instead of real proving system

**Business Impact:** This prevents production deployment and undermines confidence in TypeScript implementation equivalence.

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL PATH TASKS

### TASK 1: Implement Core Proving System APIs
**Priority:** P0  
**Effort:** 8-10 story points  
**Dependencies:** None  
**Owner:** @core-team  

#### Requirements:
- [ ] Implement `prove()` function in TypeScript core
  - Input: `components: FrameworkComponent[]`, `channel: Channel`, `commitment_scheme: CommitmentScheme`
  - Output: `Proof` object with real cryptographic commitments
- [ ] Implement `verify()` function in TypeScript core
  - Input: `proof: Proof`, `verifier: Verifier`, `commitment_scheme: CommitmentScheme`
  - Output: `boolean` verification result
- [ ] Create `Proof` class with real commitment data structure
- [ ] Create `Verifier` class with verification state management

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] `prove()` generates real cryptographic proofs (not simulations)
- [ ] `verify()` performs actual cryptographic verification
- [ ] Both functions match Rust API signatures exactly
- [ ] Unit tests pass with real cryptographic operations
- [ ] Performance benchmarks within 10% of Rust implementation
