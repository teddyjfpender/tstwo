# Orientation

This folder documents the TypeScript modules under `packages/core/src/channel`.

## Layout

- `overview.md` – high level narrative.
- `<module>.md` – one document per exported module (`index`, `blake2`, `poseidon`, `logging_channel`).
- `glossary.md` – terminology and symbols.
- `assets/` – diagrams used by the docs.

## Reading Order

1. Start with `overview.md`.
2. Refer to module docs as needed.

All diagrams use Mermaid unless otherwise noted. Equations are formatted in LaTeX.
